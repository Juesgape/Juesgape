                    I'm Juan Esteban, a programming enthusiast with a real passion for web development. I've been diving deep into this exciting field for the past two years as a student at <a className='underline' href='https://platzi.com/' target='_blank'>Platzi</a>. During that time, I've been super hands-on, taking various courses and putting my skills to the test by working on some awesome <a className="underline" href="#projects">projects</a>.

                    I've had a blast getting to know all kinds of tools and technologies along the way. React, JavaScript, Python, Tailwind, TypeScriptâ€”you name it! These are just some of the tools in my developer's toolbox that have helped me create great web applications.

                When I'm not knee-deep in coding, you'll find me exploring other interests. I've got a knack for languages, and I can speak English, Spanish, and Portuguese at a very good level. Being able to communicate effectively with different teams and users from around the world is something I truly value.

                Oh, and math? I can't get enough of it! There's something about solving problems that gets me fired up. The logical thinking and problem-solving skills I've developed through my love for math really come in handy when it comes to web development.

                I'm all about continuous learning and pushing myself to achieve top-notch performance. If there's something I don't know yet, you can bet I'll be diving headfirst into learning it.

                I'm stoked to connect with like-minded professionals who are as passionate about growth and innovation as I am. Together, we can create some truly mind-blowing web experiences that make a lasting impact.
